        <h3>MultiSwap Contributor Program</h3>
        <p>
          Community involvement doesnâ€™t start after launch but instead needs to start now. So we are launching the MultiSwap <b>Contributor Program</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The MultiSwap contributor program is an initiative to reward community members willing to help the founding team run the 
          operations and make important decisions. Some of the rewarded activities:
        </p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Liquidity mining event structure</li>
          <li>Governance process and parameters</li>
          <li>Community management</li>
          <li>Front/backend development for the website and the the MultiSwap app</li>
          <li>A Discord moderator to welcome people, repost blogs, post announcements, create polls, and general positive noise-making.</li>
          <li>Blog writers posting about new pool releases, partnerships, new product announcements, etc.</li>
          <li>Idea funnelers who can create polls, float the best ideas from the Discord community, etc.</li>
          <li>Someone reaching out to DeFi newsletters, influencers, podcasts.</li>
          <li>Someone responsible for coordinating retweets, shares, claps, upvotes for each content release.</li>
          <li>Meme Competition</li>
          <li>Airdrop Mechanism</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The Reward</h4>
        <p>
          5% of the total MULTI supply will be distributed to contributors. The more you contribute the more you are rewarded.
          Ideally these contributors will transition post LGE to join the MultiSwap operations team.
          Those chosen to receive rewards will have their tokens unlocked linearly over 1 year.
        </p>
        <h4>How It Works</h4>
        <p>
          This is genuinely an initiative to reward those willing to help with operations and those with experience offering valuable insight and direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are dedicated channels in the MultiSwap Discord for each of the above areas. Community members that actively engage in helping 
          define these by providing; insight, suggestions, feedback, requests, ideas etc. will be individually chosen by the MultiSwap ops team 
          to be rewarded with MULTI after the LGE.
